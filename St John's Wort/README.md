# This is a heading

## This is a smaller heading

### This is the heading size I'll be using for my sections

I want to italicize this *scientific plant name*.

This **word** needs bold.

If I want to quote a primary source that is more than three tines, I need to use a block quote:

> This is a large quote!
> 
> It may also be a poem.
> 
> It looks pretty great

### This is a basic map

Have a comma but no space between your longitude and latitude.
<param ve-map
	   center="38.91588,-77.06338"
	   zoom="16"
	   caption="This is the location of Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C.">

You can put a QID from Wikidata instead of coordinates.
<param ve-map
	   center="Q9679"
	   zoom="10"
	   caption="This is the Isle of Wight.">
	   
Additionally, you can use the url from openstreetmap.org which gives you the coordinates.
<param ve-map
	   center="42.37364,-71.11643"
	   zoom="15"
	   caption="Here's Harvard University.">
	   
Using geojson.io, you can also add arrows and highlighted sections, along with map markers: images pulled from wikimedia commons. Use the draw polygon button, click on the polygon to change color and line width, then click save. Copy the generated code from the right-hand side and paste it into github in a new "map.json" file. Commit changes. Open the file, click on raw, then copy the URL. Paste as a layer, removing "ref/heads". You can draw arrows on geojson to add them, and include images as markers at certain locations.
<param ve-map prefer-geojson
	   center="19.62,-42.73"
	   zoom="1.85"
	   caption="This is a map of SJW's transition from Europe to the U.S.">
<param ve-map-layer geojson
